### take notes of a long text

1. Start by telling AI like this:

> i will feed you a text and you should help me to generate a summary on the text. the text is long, so i will send you a small piece of it each time. you should only say: ok until i told you : i am done ,then you can generate the summary, if you understand, say: i understand

2. and feed text slices to AI;
3. once you have done, say:

> i am done

4. AI will generate a summary for you and then you can ask AI to help you distill something important:

   - example:

   - 
   
     <span style="float:right">i am done</span>

   > The problem with Binary Search Trees (BSTs) is that inserting nodes can break the balanced structure and increase the height. One solution is to never add a leaf node and instead add to a current leaf node. However, this can lead to a runtime of N again. A better solution is to set a limit on the number of elements in a single node and split the node in half when it reaches that limit. This maintains perfect balance and these trees are called B-trees or 2-3-4/2-3 Trees. The insertion process involves inserting into a leaf node and popping up the middle left node if necessary until the parent node can accommodate or you reach the root.

## Understanding Static vs Dynamic Types in Java

- plz summarize text given below: 

  @source: https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap4/chap42.html

  #### Type-Checking-And-Casting

  Let's go through this program line by line.

  ```java
  VengefulSLList<Integer> vsl = new VengefulSLList<Integer>(9);
  SLList<Integer> sl = vsl;
  ```

  These two lines above compile just fine. Since `VengefulSLList` "is-an" SLList, it's valid to put an instance of the `VengefulSLList` class inside an `SLList` "container".

  ```java
  sl.addLast(50);
  sl.removeLast();
  ```

  These lines above also compile. The call to `addLast` is unambiguous, as VengefulSLList did not override or implement it, so the method executed is in SLList. The `removeLast` method is overridden by VengefulSLList, however, so we take a look at the dynamic type of `sl`. Its dynamic type is VengefulSLList, and so dynamic method selection chooses the overridden method in the VengefulSLList class.

  ```java
  sl.printLostItems();
  ```

  This line above results in a compile-time error. Remember that the compiler determines whether or not something is valid based on the static type of the object. Since `sl` is of static type SLList, and `printLostItems` is not defined in the SLList class, the code will not be allowed to run, *even though* `sl`'s runtime type is VengefulSLList.

  ```java
  VengefulSLList<Integer> vsl2 = sl;
  ```

  This line above also results in a compile-time error, for a similar reason. In general, the compiler only allows method calls and assignments based on compile-time types. Since the compiler only sees that the static type of `sl` is SLList, it will not allow a VengefulSLList "container" to hold it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The text discusses a Java program that involves two classes, VengefulSLList and SLList, where the former extends the latter. The program attempts to assign an instance of VengefulSLList to an SLList container and perform various methods. The text explains that although VengefulSLList is a subtype of SLList, some method calls that rely on VengefulSLList-specific methods result in compile-time errors because the static type of the object is SLList, even though the runtime type is VengefulSLList.

- i want to make a note about the notion behide it

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, here's a possible note about the notion behind the example program:

The program illustrates the difference between the static type and the dynamic type of objects in Java. The static type of an object is its declared type, which determines the set of methods and fields that can be accessed at compile-time. The dynamic type of an object is its actual type at runtime, which may be a subtype of the static type, and determines the specific implementation of overridden methods. When a variable of a supertype is used to hold a subtype object, the static type limits the access to subtype-specific features, and may require explicit casting to access them. This can lead to compile-time errors or runtime errors if the wrong type is assumed. Therefore, it's important to understand the distinction between static and dynamic types when designing and using class hierarchies in Java.

Title: Understanding Static vs Dynamic Types in Java



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- so since the static type limits the access to subtype-specific features, and may require explicit casting to access them, why sometimes we set it as subtype?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



There are several reasons why one might want to set a variable or parameter to a subtype, even though its static type is a supertype:

1. Polymorphism: By using a supertype to refer to a subtype object, one can write more generic and reusable code that can handle different subtype instances. For example, a method that takes an Animal parameter can accept any subtype of Animal, such as Dog, Cat, or Bird, and perform some common behavior that is shared by all animals.
2. Abstraction: By hiding the details of the subtype and only exposing the common interface of the supertype, one can simplify the design and implementation of a system, and make it more modular and extensible. For example, a Shape interface can define methods such as getArea() and getPerimeter(), which can be implemented by different shape classes such as Rectangle, Circle, or Triangle.
3. Encapsulation: By limiting the visibility and accessibility of certain features of a subtype, one can enforce the principle of information hiding and protect the integrity of the data and behavior. For example, a BankAccount class can have private fields such as balance and interestRate, which can only be accessed or modified by the methods of the class, and not by external code that uses a BankAccount reference with a supertype.
4. Flexibility: By allowing the subtype to change or evolve independently of the supertype, one can adapt to changing requirements or environments without affecting the existing code that relies on the supertype. For example, a List interface can be implemented by different List classes such as ArrayList, LinkedList, or Vector, which can have different performance characteristics or features, but still provide the same basic operations such as add(), remove(), or get().

In general, the decision to use a subtype or supertype depends on the specific context and goals of the program, and requires a careful consideration of the trade-offs between generality, simplicity, security, and adaptability.

- if i use casting will it makes `sl.printLostItems()` work?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



No, using casting alone will not make `sl.printLostItems()` work. The reason for this is that casting only changes the static type of an object, not the dynamic type. In this case, although `sl` has a dynamic type of `VengefulSLList`, its static type is still `SLList`, which does not have a method called `printLostItems()`. Therefore, casting `sl` to `VengefulSLList` would only change its static type, but not its dynamic type, and thus it would not make the `printLostItems()` method accessible.

To make `sl.printLostItems()` work, you would need to declare `sl` as `VengefulSLList` instead of `SLList` from the beginning, like this: `VengefulSLList<Integer> sl = new VengefulSLList<>(...);`. This way, both the static type and dynamic type of `sl` would be `VengefulSLList`, and the `printLostItems()` method would be accessible.
